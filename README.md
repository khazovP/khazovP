## Projects

### Sigma C2

Developing a custom Command & Control (C2) framework designed for red team operations. I want to learn more about offensive security, so I decided to learn to code at least at basic level. Implemented secure communcation, automation, payload generation, and command execution features to simulate adversary tactics. More details in repo [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yourusername/Sigma-C2)

### Azure Mini SOC

Developing a small-scale SOC environment in Microsoft Azure. Already implemented network segmentation and integrated Palo Alto firewall. Set up firewall policies, routing and integrated into Azure networking. Collected basic security logs for. Next stages include Honeypot, SIEM integration and endpoint security monitoring.
