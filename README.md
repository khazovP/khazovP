Greetings! Iâ€™m a cybersecurity analyst with 3 years of experience in 24x7 SOC environments. Iâ€™m passionate about cybersecurity and technology and Iâ€™m willing to continue my career after participating in war in Ukraine. I am constantly learning new things by working on hands-on projects, focusing on threat detection, security automation, and incident response. This portfolio showcases my work and contributions to the field of cybersecurity.

## ðŸš€ Projects  

### **Sigma C2 â€“ Custom Command & Control Framework**  
**Offensive security meets hands-on development.** Sigma C2 is a custom-built **Command & Control (C2) framework** designed for **red team operations**. The goal? To dive into **offensive security** and pushing myself to learn coding fundamentals. 
Project implements: 
* C2 architecture
* Secure communication
* Automation
* Payload generation
* Remote command execution

ðŸ”—**More details:** [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/khazovP/Sigma-C2)

### **Azure Mini SOC â€“ Cybersecurity Lab in the Cloud**  
A **cloud-based Security Operations Center (SOC) simulation** for **threat detection, monitoring, and analysis** in Azure. The **Mini SOC** is built on a **segmented, firewall-protected network** featuring a **Palo Alto firewall, honeypot, target host with EDR, EDR server, attacker machine, and SIEM**.  

#### **Phase 1: Laying the Foundation**  
The first step was to **build a secure and scalable network** to serve as the backbone for future cybersecurity operations:  
âœ… **Network segmentation** to isolate security zones.  
âœ… **Palo Alto firewall integration** for traffic control, policies, and routing.  
âœ… **Seamless Azure networking** to ensure proper communication between components.  

This phase **set the stage for advanced security monitoring** in later phases.

#### **Phase 2: Threat Detection & SIEM Integration**  
With the foundation in place, the focus shifted to **log collection, threat visibility, and security insights** through **Microsoft Sentinel SIEM**:  
ðŸ”¥ **Log Collector deployment** to centralize logs from the **firewall and Cowrie honeypot**.  
ðŸ”¥ **Firewall log forwarding in CEF format** for structured event ingestion.  
ðŸ”¥ **Honeypot attack capture** â€“ tracking SSH brute force attempts in real time.  
ðŸ”¥ **Custom log parsing & Sentinel dashboards** for actionable threat intelligence.  
ðŸ”¥ **Azure troubleshooting deep dive**, solving NAT/SNAT challenges and ingress/egress quirks.  

Now, the **Mini SOC** is actively **detecting threats, correlating attack data, and visualizing insights** with **custom security dashboards**.
